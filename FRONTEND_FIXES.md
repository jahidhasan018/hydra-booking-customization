# Frontend Data Display Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Profile Data Mapping Issue
**Problem**: The Vue.js component was not correctly mapping the profile data from the AJAX response.

**Root Cause**: The backend returns profile data in this structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "profile": {
      "first_name": "Jahid",
      "last_name": "Hossain", 
      "email": "admin@monoshilon.com",
      "display_name": "abir",
      "description": "",
      "host_data": {
        "id": "1",
        "user_id": "1",
        "first_name": "abir",
        "phone_number": "",
        "about": "",
        "time_zone": "",
        // ... other host data
      }
    }
  }
}
```

But the Vue component was expecting a simple `data.profile` assignment without properly mapping the nested `host_data` properties.

**Fix**: Updated the `loadProfile` function in `HostDashboard.vue` to properly map profile data:
- Maps WordPress user data (first_name, last_name, email, etc.)
- Maps host-specific data from `host_data` object (phone_number → phone, about → bio, time_zone → timezone)
- Added debug logging to track data flow

### 2. Stats Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: The Vue component expected stats data to be wrapped in a `stats` object, but the backend returns stats directly.

**Root Cause**: Backend returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "today_meetings": 0,
    "upcoming_meetings": 0,
    "completed_meetings": 0,
    "active_join_links": 0
  }
}
```

But Vue component was looking for `data.stats.today_meetings`.

**Fix**: Updated `loadStats` function to assign stats directly: `Object.assign(stats, data || {})`

### 3. Bookings Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Similar to stats, the Vue component expected bookings to be wrapped in a `bookings` object.

**Root Cause**: Backend returns bookings array directly, but Vue component was looking for `data.bookings`.

**Fix**: Updated `loadBookings` function to handle array directly: `bookings.value = Array.isArray(data) ? data : []`

### 4. API Parameter Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend was sending `type` parameter but backend expected `period` parameter for booking queries.

**Root Cause**: API method was sending `{ action: 'hbc_get_host_bookings', type }` but backend was reading `$_POST['period']`.

**Fix**: Updated API utility to send correct parameter: `{ action: 'hbc_get_host_bookings', period: type }`

### 5. Join Links Data Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent handling of join links data structure.

**Fix**: Updated `loadJoinLinks` function to handle both wrapped and direct array responses.

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/HostDashboard.vue**
   - Fixed profile data mapping with proper host_data integration
   - Fixed stats data assignment
   - Fixed bookings data assignment
   - Fixed join links data assignment
   - Added comprehensive debug logging

2. **src/utils/api.js**
   - Fixed parameter name from `type` to `period` for getBookings API call

3. **dist/host-dashboard.js** (rebuilt)
   - Contains the compiled fixes

## Debug Features Added

Added console logging in all data loading functions to help troubleshoot:
- `console.log('Profile data received:', data)`
- `console.log('Stats data received:', data)`
- `console.log('Bookings data received:', data)`
- `console.log('Join links data received:', data)`

These logs will help identify any remaining data flow issues.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ensure the new JavaScript files are loaded
2. **Open Browser Developer Tools**: Check the Console tab for debug logs
3. **Visit Host Dashboard**: Navigate to the host dashboard page
4. **Check Console Logs**: You should see data being received and assigned
5. **Verify Display**: Profile information, stats, and bookings should now display correctly

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Profile data should display correctly (name, email, phone, bio, timezone)
- ✅ Stats cards should show correct numbers (today's meetings, upcoming, completed, active links)
- ✅ Bookings should load and display in the appropriate tabs
- ✅ Join links should load and display correctly
- ✅ All AJAX calls should work without parameter mismatches

## Troubleshooting

If data still doesn't display:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug messages to see what data is being received
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify AJAX calls are successful and returning expected data
3. **Check Nonce**: Ensure WordPress nonce is valid and not expired
4. **Check User Permissions**: Verify user has `tfhb_host` role and proper host data in database

## Next Steps

1. Test the dashboard thoroughly
2. Remove debug logging once everything is working (optional)
3. Consider adding error handling for edge cases
4. Monitor for any additional data mapping issues
